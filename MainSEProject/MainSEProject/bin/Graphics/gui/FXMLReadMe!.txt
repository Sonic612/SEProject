-In order to view fully the .fxml files you will need the JavaFX scene builder.
-There is also the option of using text files in order to see them.
-Go To: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/javafxscenebuilder-1x-archive-2199384.html to download scene builder 2.0. WARNING: Java does say that security for this is not up-to-date, however it is the latest version of scene builder I could find.
